# Getting Started with Create React App `npx create-react-app "appname"` later migrated with VITE
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx`
This command will lint all the files in your project with .js and .jsx extensions, and apply the rules you've defined.

### `npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx --fix`
This will attempt to automatically fix linting errors (like indentation issues) based on your configuration.
